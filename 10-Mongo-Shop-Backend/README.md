# Online Shop

## Purpose

It's an important skill, that cannot be learned in form
of syntax, to figure out models for an App.

In this exercise I want you to think about and create,
the model for a simple online shop.

## Models

### User (easy)

OFC every shop needs a user/authentication system, besides
the normal fields like name, email, password..

What extra fields would you need for this kind of shop? 
Which information is important to the shop-owner and the customer?

### Item (medium)

A shop would be boring without things to sell.
What would you include in an Item model?
Think about the things you see in online shops that you know.

### Order (hard)

When a customer picks items he adds them into a basket.
Let's say this happens in the frontend... in the end the customer
will place an order, so a list of items and amounts...
Try to create a model for this, including all the important
information that the shop-owner needs to process the order,
and send out the package.

### Extras

You may create extra models that i did not mention here, but this
is not striclty required.

Try to get as far as you can. Try to use a structur that takes one
file per model.

You dont have to create routes, but: it should not thow any errors.
